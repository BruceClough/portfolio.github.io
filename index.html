        <h2>About this website</h2>
        <p>This website is a project in my journey of learning HTML, CSS & JS. While I'm learning,
            I'm changing things in the site. The intention is to create a portfolio in order that people
            like you can see my abilities. However, take in mind that my main ability is learning. Whichever
            technology that you work with, I can learn it and be proficient in a few months. As you can see in my CV,
            I'm a passionate about learning, especially languages & things related to Computer Science. I hope you
            enjoy this project and that I hope to be working with you soon.
        </p>
